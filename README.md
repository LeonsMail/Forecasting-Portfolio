# Forecasting-Portfolio
## Overview

This repository contains my Forecasting Portfolio, which demonstrates various forecasting techniques using Python, Anaconda, and Jupyter Notebook. The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my expertise in time series forecasting, data preprocessing, and model evaluation for forecasting applications.

## Files and Notebooks

## Manual_Modeling_&_Batch_Modeling.ipynb

A Jupyter Notebook containing detailed step-by-step manual modeling and batch modeling approaches for time series forecasting.

Covers data exploration, seasonal decomposition, trend analysis, and statistical model fitting.

Includes Python code for loading data, filtering, time series transformation, visualization, and forecasting.

Manual_Modeling_&_Batch_Modeling.pdf

A PDF version of the notebook for easy viewing and sharing.

## Key Features

Data Preparation: Reads Excel files, filters time series data, and prepares in-sample and out-sample datasets.

Time Series Analysis: Extracts seasonal and trend components, plots seasonal subseries, and generates decomposition plots.

Statistical Forecasting: Applies Exponential Smoothing, Linear Regression with Seasonal Components, and evaluates models based on MAPE & MASE.

Model Selection: Identifies the best model for forecasting using error metrics.

Visualization: Generates high-quality TIFF and SVG images for analysis.

## How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/Forecasting-Portfolio.git

Navigate to the repository folder:

cd Forecasting-Portfolio

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Manual_Modeling_&_Batch_Modeling.ipynb

Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+

Anaconda / Jupyter Notebook

Required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy xlwings matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn openpyxl

## Next Steps

Implement advanced forecasting techniques, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or Prophet.

Expand the portfolio with additional datasets and case studies.

Improve model evaluation with cross-validation techniques.
